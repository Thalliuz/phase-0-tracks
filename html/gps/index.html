<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
   - So Semantic tags are more clearly readable tags for the developer and the browser. I personally find <nav> and <section> useful for the nav to define where your navigation bar will be and the section to section up your page.  
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
   - The browser will interpret the code from top to bottom so elements listed first with their respective nested elements will be loaded first.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
   - I learned how to create snippets and that they can help you create repetitive code easily. Also I learned some extra shortcuts. I will most definitely be using snippets and shortcuts to my advantage! 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
   - The <aside> and <main> tag concepts I had some trouble with, by the end of the session I had a firm understanding of the main and aside tag but to improve my understanding in the future of concepts alike and new I will use my resources ( e.g. google, cohort mates and office hours) to fortify my knowledge. -->
